# Kawa 🏞️

Kawa (川) is a simple livestream application that consists of [`kawa-ingest 🛤`](https://github.com/sanstzu/kawa-ingest) and [`kawa-transcoder ⚙️`](https://github.com/sanstzu/kawa-transcoder), fully written in Rust 🦀.

# Kawa-Ingest 🛤

The ingest service is responsible for receiving RTMP streams. It is made using `rml-rtmp` and `tokio` for async handling of incoming streams. The output for each stream would be `[AWS_S3_OUT_URI]/out/[stream_key]`.

The raw video and audio bytes is being used to extract NAL units and ADTS frames, which are then sent to the transcoder service through gRPC stream.

> The ingest service is designed to be used with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), a popular open-source software for video recording and live streaming. As of now, it only supports `h264` and `aac` codec for video and audio respectively.

# Kawa-Transcoder ⚙️

The transcoder service employs `ffmpeg` to transcode the incoming gRPC stream to HLS format (MPEG-TS container).

It also utilizes `aws-cli` to upload the transcoded media files to an S3 bucket that serves as a CDN for the HLS stream. As for now, the stream will be published to `[AWS_S3_OUTPUT_URI]/[stream_key]`. For better practice, it would be better to have a key-value store to map a stream key to a particular publish path (e.g. Redis).

## To-Do 📝

- [ ] README.md for both services.
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for both services (currently for `kawa-ingest` only).
- [ ] Create docker-compose file for both services.
- [ ] Add tests.
- [ ] Improve from 30 seconds latency.
